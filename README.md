# Exotic-material-design
This repository gathers the complete numerical and experimental pipeline developed for the design and validation of R0-orthotropic mechanical metamaterials, i.e. orthotropic elastic media with isotropic deviatoric response.

The numerical framework is based on a level-set topology optimization method driven by topological derivatives, applied to multiscale linear elasticity models. Microstructures are synthesized by enforcing invariant-based objectives derived from harmonic decomposition and symmetry analysis of the elasticity tensor.

The designed microstructures are experimentally validated using the Virtual Fields Method (VFM), relying on full-field displacement measurements and force data to identify effective stiffness tensors and assess the targeted symmetry properties.

This repository includes:
	•	Multiscale finite-element homogenization of periodic microstructures
	•	Level-set evolution based on topological sensitivity analysis + Invariant-driven optimization toward R0-orthotropy
	•	Experimental identification and uncertainty analysis via VFM
